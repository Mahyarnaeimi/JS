## Wins
1. Visual & Typographic Identity

I’ve integrated a custom serif font (“Rosarivo”) and gradient‑based text styling (in headings, logo, nav link underlines). This gives the design a strong brand presence and polished feel across devices.

2. Clean, Responsive Layout

The .container wrapper establishes consistent centering and padding across sections.

Responsive grid patterns (e.g., .skills-grid, .about-content, .projects-grid) adapt cleanly for different screen widths.

Thoughtful media queries ensure font sizes and layouts shift appropriately below 768 px, optimizing for mobile.

3. Visual Cohesion with Hero & Gradients

The hero section’s gradient background and large, gradient-filled heading create a visually stunning first impression.

Consistent use of the green–orange–brown palette unifies the site’s mood and aesthetic.

4. Interactive & Engaging UI Elements

Hover effects across navigation links, project cards, skill cards, and buttons add polish and indicate interactivity.

The .cta-button with backdrop-filter, color transitions, and subtle shadow offers a modern, tactile feel.

5. Modular & Semantic Structure

Clear HTML sections with IDs and class names (.hero, .about-content, .project-card) ensure maintainability and a solid foundation for enhancements.

CSS is organized by section, with reusable components like .container, .project-tech, .skill-category, making future modifications easier.

## Difficulties & Challenges
1. Consistent Use of Relative Units

I’ve used px extensively (e.g., font sizes, element dimensions) which can reduce scalability.

Transitioning to rem/em percentages could improve responsiveness and accessibility across varied devices and user preferences.

2. Fixed-Width Assets

Specific widths like 350px or 200px for .profile-image can hinder adaptability.

These may break layout on ultra-small or ultra-large screens. A more fluid or max-width approach using percentages would enhance flexibility.

3. Asset Loading & Paths

Many image references use relative paths (e.g., ../Unit1-Personal-Portfolio/asset/...) which may cause broken links depending on deployment.

Managing asset directories effectively and using absolute or root-referenced paths will support robustness in deployment.

4. Accessibility Considerations

Some images lack meaningful alt text (“Project Image”), which hinders screen reader usability.

Color contrast—especially subtle gradients or lighter text on mixed backgrounds—might present issues for visually impaired users.

Adding aria-labels, improving alt tags, and verifying text contrast ratios would increase inclusivity.

5. Repetition & DRY CSS Opportunities

Similar hover transitions appear across multiple selectors (project-card:hover, skill-category:hover, .contact-item:hover).

Extracting these into reusable utility classes could reduce repetition and streamline future style updates.

6. Potential Performance Overhead

The semi-transparent fixed header with backdrop-filter might cause rendering lag in some browsers.

The large gradients and font imports may slightly increase initial load time. Consider performance optimizations like CSS minification, critical‑CSS inlining, and limiting font weights/styles when scaling.

## Summary
This portfolio demonstrates strong aesthetic planning, effective use of modern CSS techniques (gradients, flex/grid, hover states), and a responsive, modular structure. These confirm your solid front-end foundation. To elevate it further you can:

Adopt relative sizing (rem, %) for scalability.

Optimize asset paths and accessibility features (alt texts, contrast, ARIA).

DRY-out repetitive CSS.

Perform performance enhancements for real-world users.

Overall, the project is tried to be a well-structured, visually rich presentation that strikes a balance between creative flair and web best practices—especially for a CG artist transitioning into web development.
